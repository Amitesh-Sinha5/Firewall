# Firewall
HoneyTrap Firewall is a Python-based security app with a Tkinter GUI for user and admin login, signup, and management. It assigns users to random active ports and detects attackers, redirecting them to honeypot portals. Admins can monitor activity, manage users, and control ports in real time.
